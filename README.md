TODO
- Mutations kinda work but not really. Get them working, might need an actual FIELD to make the
on-the-fly update. Right now, only if I refresh page does the number change, which is
not something I want.

I think a better mutation to do would be once we have a profile page, click edit, and the fields
will change, and then see the changes reflected.
